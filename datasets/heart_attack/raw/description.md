# About Dataset

This is a heart dataset.

You can perform classification on this dataset.

There are 13 attributes: 

1. Age: Age (in years) 

2. Sex: gender (1 = male; 0 = female) 

3. ChestPain: Chest Pain type -- 1: typical angina (all criteria present) -- 2:
   atypical angina (two of three criteria satisfied) -- 3: non-anginal pain
   (less than one criteria satisfied) -- 4: asymptomatic (none of the criteria
   are satisfied) 

4. Restbps: Resting Blood pressure (in mmHg, upon admission to the hospital) 

5. Chol: serum cholesterol in mg/dL 

6. Fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL (likely to be diabetic) 1 = true; 0 =
   false 

7. RestECG: Resting electrocardiogram results -- Value 0: normal -- Value 1:
   having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or
   depression of > 0.05 mV) -- Value 2: showing probable or definite left
   ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria 

8. MaxHR: Greatest number of beats per minute your heart can possibly reach
   during all-out strenuous exercise. 

9. Exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) 

10. Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (in mm, achieved by subtracting the
    lowest ST segment points during exercise and rest) 

11. Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, ST-T abnormalities are
    considered to be a crucial indicator for identifying presence of ischaemia
    -- Value 1: upsloping -- Value 2: flat -- Value 3: downsloping 

12. Ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy. Major cardial
    vessels are as goes: aorta, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava,
    pulmonary artery (oxygen-poor blood --> lungs), pulmonary veins
    (oxygen-rich blood --> heart), and coronary arteries (supplies blood to
    heart tissue). 

13. AHD: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect (heart tissue can't absorb thallium both
    under stress and in rest); 2 = reversible defect (heart tissue is unable to
    absorb thallium only under the exercise portion of the test) 

14. AHD: 0 = no disease, 1 = disease
